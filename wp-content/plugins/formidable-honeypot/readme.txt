Add SPAM protection to your Formidable forms without annoying your visitors with Captchas, math, or other fields.

== Description ==

The "honeypot" technique for SPAM protection is invisible to humans, and tricks robots into filling out an invisible form field. Then, if that invisible field has been filled, the form cannot be submitted. Easy, non-instrusive SPAM protection.

No settings to set, this honeypot is added to all Formidable forms on your site, unless the user is logged in. When SPAM is suspected, the form will not be submitted and the visitor will be alerted to this fact.

Tested to work with both **Formidable** (free) and [Formidable Pro](http://www.wpbiz.co/go/forms) (best bet for awesome form power!)

**A note to Formidable Pro users:** You paid to receive extra features in the Formidable plugin. Me too, it's well worth it. This Honeypot plugin, and Ryan (the developer) are not connected to Formidable in any way. Since this adds another very helpful feature to Formidable, I ask you to send a [donation at WPbiz.co](http://wpbiz.co/donate/) to say thanks and encourage future developemnt.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and activate the plugin.
1. It will automatically add honeypot protection to all Formidable forms.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can SPAM still sneak through somehow? =

Sure, it's possible. There's no way to know exactly how every spam bot works. Or in some cases, SPAM messages can be filled in by real people.

= Will it ever block real people by accident? =

Again, it's possible. One way it could happen is if the user has an "auto-fill" feature on their browser. We will be doing our best to prevent this from happening, but there's never a guarantee. There is a message that tells people their response was not successful, so at least they know it happened and can contact you directly.

= Does it work with both Free and Pro versions of Formidable? =

Yes, it adds a honeypot to all forms, regardless of whether you have the [Pro](http://www.wpbiz.co/go/forms) or Free versions of Formidable.

== Screenshots ==

1. Nothing to see here, but enough to trap robots.
